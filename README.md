# Malay-Text-Classifier
This repository contains a simple guide to build a Malay text classifier using Scikit-Learn

# Introduction
Text classification refers to the ability of our machine to categorize texts or documents into
different categories based on their content. It is useful across a variety of applications such as
sentiment analysis, email spam classification, automation of products category classification
based on the description, and so on. Text classification has always been an active research in
the community of natural language processing, machine learning and deep learning. However,
most of the research conducted is primarily focused on text classification on English languages.
The performance of text classification by machine in other languages especially Malay is still
poor as compared to English. Therefore, this project will be focused on developing a Malay
Text classifier to perform text classification tasks on Malay documents or texts.
